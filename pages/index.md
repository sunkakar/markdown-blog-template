### Introduction 

During my 4 years at IUPUI, being an International student, I traveled numerous times to India. At least twice a year. My primary source of communication has been through Whatsapp with the closest people in my life. Using my Chat History with multiple people, in America or in India, I will visualize the messages in the last 4 years to show trends in communication based on my location during periods of time (while I was in India or in the US). 

### Beginning 

I had to start with writing Scripts.
